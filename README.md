# MOOC.FI
In this GitHub branch you will find my answers to the MOOC.FI course part 8.14, from University of Helsinki. Feel free to use it for comparing or as an inspiration on how to start your own exercises. I have commented along my way with many of the exercises. Some comments in danish other in english, as I thought I wouldn't be needing to publish later on. However if you have any question, feel free to pm me. Good luck and have fun :)
